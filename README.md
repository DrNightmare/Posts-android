# Posts-android
A very simple (practice) native Android app that extracts posts from an online API and displays them.

The app uses [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make calls to a fake REST API at [JSONPlaceholder](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and displays the returned data in a recycler view.

Also, a [divider line](http://stackoverflow.com/a/31243174/3518846) is used to separate items in the recycler view.

Will be pushing more updates as and when I add new stuff.
